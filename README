== Brandizzle

h1. Testing

The test suite uses the following components:

* RSpec
* Cucumber
* Spork
* Borne
* Factory Girl

Brandizzle is setup with Spork to speed up the BDD cycle. To start the servers:

<pre>
  bundle exec spork
  bundle exec spork cucumber
</pre>

TODO: Add note about just running tests (i.e. not continuously)

To run the tests in a continuously, execute:

<pre>
  autotest -- --skip-bundler
</pre>

TODO: Add a standard method for cucumber. See https://github.com/guard/guard-cucumber

To generate RSpec documentation:

<pre>
  rspec spec/ --format documentation
</pre>

To run code metrics:

<pre>
  metrical
</pre>

To run test coverage (exit Spork for RSpec and Cucumber while running as you will get no output):

<pre>
  rake cover_me:all
</pre>
